<h1> About </h1>
 <div id="origins">
 <h2> Origins </h2>
 
    <p> Catfish and the Bottlemen are an indie rock band from Llandudno, Wales in April 2007. Although they are from Wales, only one of <br />
	the current members is actually Welsh (See <a href="./CatfishMembers.html"><strong><u>Members</u></strong> </a> Page). They were founded when Van McCann (Lead Singer) moved to <br />
	Wales after travelling to Australia with his parents. McCann's parents opened a Bed and Breakfast, which meant McCann had <br />
	to sleep in a closet, as there was not enough space. McCann made friends with Stephen and William "Billy" Bibby, whose parents <br />
	also owned a B&B. Billy taught McCann how to play guitar, where they wrote some early versions of their current songs. They <br />
	were originally known as "The Prestige". Shortly after, Benji Blakeway joined them as the bassist of the band. Bibby also taught <br />
	him how to play guitar. Jon Barr, who was a school friend of theirs, joined them on drums as the fourth member of the band.</p>

<h2> Replacements </h2>
	
	<p> In 2010, Barr was replaced by Robert "Bob" Hall, who was introduced by one of the band's producers at the time. In 2014, Bibby <br />
	suddenly left the band in order to look towards his own future. Despite having no plans initially, he founded a new band in 2015, <br />
	<a href="https://www.billybibby.com/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Billy Bibby and The Wry Smiles.</u></strong> </a> He was replaced by Johnny Bond. </p>

<h2> Name Meaning </h2>

    <p> The bands name comes from one of McCann's memories from his time in Australia. He saw a busker in Sydney who went by the <br />
	name of "Catfish the Bottleman". He played beer bottles which were strung on a wire. He adopted the name "Catfish" as he had a <br />
	strangely styled beard, similar to a catfish's, when he started busking in 2000. </p>

    <p> "The Ride" was Catfish and the Bottlemen's second album, released in 2016. This album's cover has a picture of an alligator <br />
    eating its own tail. Van McCann chose this image as he wrote some of the songs in a place called "The Alligator Lounge". He said <br />
    "That's where we'd go to smoke and cut loose". In the UK, the album reached No. 1 on the UK albums chart. In the US, it peaked at <br />
